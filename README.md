> JHipster is a development platform to quickly generate, develop, and deploy modern web applications and microservice architectures. We support many frontend technologies, including Angular, React, and Vue. We even have mobile app support for Ionic and React Native! On the backend, we support Spring Boot (with Java or Kotlin), Micronaut, Quarkus, Node.js, and .NET. For deployment, we embrace cloud native principles with Docker and Kubernetes. Deployment support exists for AWS, Azure, Cloud Foundry, Google Cloud Platform, Heroku, and OpenShift.

# Greetings, Kotlin Hipster!

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]

This project adds Kotlin to the JHipster application üòé. It is based on JHipster Blueprint üîµ.

## üöÄ How to get started

Install the package with `npm install -g generator-jhipster-kotlin`

1. Make sure you have `yo` installed with `npm install -g yo`
2. Install the package with `npm install -g generator-jhipster-kotlin`
3. Generate the application with `khipster`

## Using Docker

Download the Dockerfile:

```bash
mkdir docker
cd docker
wget https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-kotlin/raw/main/docker/Dockerfile
```

Build the Docker images:

```bash
docker build -t jhipster-generator-kotlin:latest .
```

Make a folder where you want to generate the Service:

```bash
mkdir service
cd service
```

Run the generator from image to generate service:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/home/khipster/app jhipster-generator-kotlin
```

Run and attach interactive shell to the generator docker container to work from inside the running container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/home/khipster/app jhipster-generator-kotlin /bin/bash
```
